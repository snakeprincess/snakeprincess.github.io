                <p>Social services has many functions. It extends health care access to adults with disabilities or mental disorders, sometimes through government programs and other times by connecting them with community resources. Social services also helps people of all ages obtain necessities, such as food, water and shelter.<br><br>

                    One of the major areas of focus for social services is the family, especially the well-being of children. Social services becomes involved in cases of domestic abuse or neglect. Caseworkers help parents and spouses find quality counseling. Often, these cases have legal ramifications, so caseworkers also help families navigate the complexities of the court system.
                    
                    Social services makes sure that children are in a stable, safe environment. When necessary, it places children in foster care or in an orphanage. Even after adoption, social services observes the progress and integration of children for a period of time.<br><br>
                    
                    Social services is distinct from public services, which are utilities like water, power, sanitation and transportation. It is also separate from civil service, which facilitates citizen’s interaction with the government in places like government agencies and the post office.Every website should be built with two primary goals:Firstly,it needs to work across all devices. Secondly, it needs to be fast as possible.Personal services, in contract law, refers to the special and oftentimes unique abilities and talents of individuals that cannot be replaced by the abilities and talents of another person. Therefore, personal services are more greatly valued than general labor. A contract for personal services usually imposes a duty to render the service, as well as a duty to forbear from rendering the service to a competitor. Some example of individuals who can perform personal services are actors, singers, athletes. <br><br>

                    According to the Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 367, “a promise to render personal service will not be specifically enforced” and “a promise to render personal service exclusively for one employer will not be enforced by an injunction against serving another if its probable result will be to compel a performance involving personal relations the enforced continuance of which is undesirable or will be to leave the employee without other reasonable means of making a living.” The rationale for this refusal to require specific performance of a personal services contract is that it would not be desirable to further personal associations between parties if there have already been disputes leading to a loss of confidence and loyalty. In addition, the quality of the personal services performance may be lowered if an individual’s sole motivation for performing is because he or she compelled to fulfill a contract obligation under law, but quality of performance is difficult to judge and quantify.
                    
                   <br><br> Furthermore, in some states, like California, if a company’s principal activity is the performance of personal services and owner employees substantially perform those personal services, they may be classified as a special type of corporation called a personal service corporation.</p>
